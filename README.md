# Maze-Solver

This maze solver visually solves mazes using DFS.

## How to use
All mazes must be in text file form with **#** as walls, **S** as the starting point, and **E** as the end point. All mazes must also be surrounded by walls and be a rectangle. (Some sample mazes are provided)

1. Put the text file in the same folder as the code
2. Upon running the code, users will be prompted to enter the name of the file in the terminal
3. To make the visualizer speed up/slow down, users can edit the **UPDATE_DELAY** value in the **Const.java** file.
